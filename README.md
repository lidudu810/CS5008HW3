How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment (estimate)? 

Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell us who and in what capacity.  
- one per row, add more if needed


Did you use any external resources (you do not have to cite in class material)? (Cite them below)  
- one row per resource


(Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment? 

(Optional) How would you improve the assignment? 

## Further Thinking Questions

1. Circular queues are used quite a bit in operating systems and high performance systems, especially when performance matters. Do a little outside research, and answer this question specifically: Why is a ring buffer useful and/or when should it be used? 
2. We are going to talk about stacks quite a lot in this course, so it will be important to understand them. Do a little outside research, and edit this section of the readme answering specifically: Why is a stack useful and/or when should it be used?



For each of these questions, we are expecting your answer to be in the range of 2-3 paragraphs (can include complexity, example usage, pros/cons, etc). Make sure to cite your sources. It is recommended you use [IEEE citation style](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/ieee_style/ieee_overview.htm) as it is most common for CS papers and research. 


## Important notes

* Your code **must compile and run** on the Khoury machines to earn credit. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we grade your assignments.
* You must commit any additional files(if any) into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* Do not forget, once you have pushed your changes to your repo make sure that you **submit them to Gradescope before the assignment deadline!**
